Hi there!

I'm a freelance creative web developer who helps small businesses like yours grow with the use of their site. I sent you this email because I'd like to know if you're interested in affordable but high-quality web design services. I'm an expert with the WordPress website platform, and I'm also skilled with many other platforms and shopping carts as well. If you'd like, I can show you some of my previous work to give you a better idea of what I am capable of accomplishing for the benefit of your business. 

If you already have some design ideas in mind, I'd like to know them and help you implement all of it to the site. I've also got some ideas (of which I'd love for you to hear) that will make use of what existing elements you have on your site and make it even better. I could also build you a completely new site with all the modern features that your business will need if that's what you prefer.

I'll provide you with a free consultation over the phone in the next few days if you are interested. I'll share you some ideas, get your feedback and give you a proposal. I'd really like to be of assistance and make the site better, so please reply about the best time to contact you. Talk to you soon! 

- Jack Reed
